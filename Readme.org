#+TITLE: Linear Regression

* Linear Regression
This project was create in order to folow along with the ISLR book. This is not
meant to be used in in production as it will likely be way slower than other
much better libraries (Sklearn, etc..)

* Features

*  Tasks
- [X] The fit method
  - [X] Calculate the coeficients of regression
- [X] The score method (calculate the r2 square)
- [X] Check the data before the fit method (No nans and so on)
- [ ] Visualizing the data
  - Make a scatter matrix of all the variables with the curve and the r2 score
- [ ] Feature selection
  - Select the best festures for the regression
