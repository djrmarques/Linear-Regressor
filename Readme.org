#+TITLE: Linear Regression

* Linear Regression
This project was created as I followed along with ISLR chapter 2. This is not
meant to be used in in production as it will likely be way slower than other
much better libraries (Sklearn, etc..)

* Tasks
- [X] The fit method
  - [X] Calculate the coeficients of regression
- [X] The score method (calculate the r2 square)
- [X] Check the data before the fit method (No nans and so on)
- [ ] Implement a method based on the statsmodel library.
- [ ] Feature selection
  - Select the best festures for the regression
